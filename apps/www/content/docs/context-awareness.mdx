Amical's context awareness feature intelligently adapts transcription based on the applications you're using, providing more accurate and relevant results.

## How It Works

When you're using Amical, it automatically detects which application is currently active and adjusts its transcription behavior accordingly. This means:

- Different formatting rules for different apps
- Specialized vocabulary recognition based on context
- Optimized transcription settings for each use case
